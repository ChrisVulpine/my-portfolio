        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p id="about-me-text">I have been a wedding and family photographer for 10 years, however as 2023 came to a close, I felt a desire to make a career change. My passion in life is to create things for people to enjoy. Now it is 2024, and I decided to pursue a passion I never really knew I had. Gaming has been part of my life since I could hold a controller. It all began with a red-hatted Italian plumber. I stumbled into coding years ago and had fun with it, but it wasn't until I looked back at it in January 2024 that it hit me. I loved this! Now I want to make things for people to enjoy.<br>
            <br>
             My focus will be developing apps, games, and websites. I am sure in the coming weeks that focus will get more and more narrow. I look forward to where this new adventure into making the computer go boop takes me.<br>
