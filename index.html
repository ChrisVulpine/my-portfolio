            I want all photo sessions to be enjoyable and fun, so during sessions with me you are liable to hear some jokes. My goal is to capture memories in ways that let people look back and smile. I have been a photographer since 2013. I am a happily married man to the woman of my dreams. She is my beautiful partner in this whole adventure. I lean heavily on a good cup of coffee to get me going most mornings. I enjoy heading outdoors on hikes with my wife and our dog Gidget. I love to create things. Photography, cooking, writing I have a passion for it all. I look forward to getting to know and working with you.  - Chris </p>
